    <p>
      This privacy policy discloses the privacy practices for <a href="http://www.acodeabove.com">acodeabove.com</a>.
      This privacy policy applies solely to information collected by this web site. It will notify you of the following:
    </p>

    <ol>
      <li>What personally identifiable information is collected from you through the web site, how it is used, and with whom it may be shared.</li>
      <li>What choices are available to you regarding the use of your data.</li>
      <li>The security procedures in place to protect the misuse of your information.</li>
      <li>How you can correct any inaccuracies in the information.</li>
    </ol>

    <h3>Information Collection, Use, and Sharing</h3>
    <p>
      We are the sole owners of the information collected on this site.
      We only have access to/collect information that you voluntarily give us via email or other direct contact from you.
      We will not sell or rent this information to anyone.
    </p>
    <p>
      We will use your information to respond to you, regarding the reason you contacted us.
      We will not share your information with any third party outside of our organization,
      other than as necessary to fulfill your request, e.g. to ship an order.
    </p>

    <p>
      Unless you ask us not to, we may contact you via email in the future to tell you about specials, new products or services, or changes to this privacy policy.
    </p>

    <h3>Orders</h3>
    <p>
      We may request information from you on our order form. To buy from us, you must
      provide contact information (like name and mailing address).
      If we have trouble processing an order, we'll use this information to contact you.
      All of our orders are currently processed via Amazon Payments, and we do not
      directly handle any sensitive information, such as credit card numbers or
      billing addresses.
    </p>
    <p>
      We may partner with another party to provide specific services, such as domain and web hosting.
      When the user signs up for these services, we may share names, or other contact information
      that is necessary for the third party to provide these services.
      These parties are not allowed to use personally identifiable information, except for the purpose of providing these services.
    </p>
